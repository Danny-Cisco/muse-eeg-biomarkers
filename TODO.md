# Todo...

- [ ] maybe improve preprocessing

  - add filtering?
  - maybe process 10 second epochs?
  - then discard bad epochs?

- [ ] cell to remove duplicate rows from biomarkers.csv

- [ ] create visualisations for csv

  - week, month, all
  - might need to rethink the way band peaks are documented?
  - or maybe make a 3d version of the overview?

- [ ] dont forget, reprocessing the data is easy, just keep capturing it.
